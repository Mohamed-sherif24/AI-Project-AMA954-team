# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
what do we mean by "optimal routes" for a VRP?
The routes with the least total distance. However, if there are no other constraints, the optimal solution is to assign just one vehicle to visit all locations, and find the shortest route for that vehicle.

We have used ortools library, ortools is a software library developed by Google for operations research and constraint programming. It provides a variety of tools and algorithms for solving optimization problems, including solvers for linear and integer programming, constraint programming, and vehicle routing.

To install ortools, you will need to have Python installed on your system. ortools is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 or later.
To install ortools using pip, the Python package manager, open a terminal window and enter the following command:

> **pip install ortools**
